# nc-vue-start

## Before Reading:

Applicable to the following situations：

1. Users who don't want to introduce Vue through the `script` tag, or experienced Vue enthusiasts who want to get rid of `cli` to complete personal projects.。
2. Want to try `Front-end Engineering`, willing to start your Vue project environment from 0 to 1 from `Webpack` instead of `Vite`。



## illustrate：

**The project realizes the use of `dev/build` of `Vue2/Vue3` through the basic configuration of `Webpack5`.**

+ You can use this project to build a simple `Vue` project

+ You can integrate third-party packages such as`npm install lodash, axios`

+ Or in the Vue ecosystem`npm install Vue-router, Vuex`

+ At the same time, you can also seek more `loader` or `plugin support` by consulting `Webpack` official documentation，Such as TypeScript support `npm install ts-loader -D`。

+ Or code style detection `prettier`。



**In short, this project is just an Beginning. Based on this, you can use more documents and more configurations to complete a Webpack-based Vue project configuration solution that meets your own needs.**
